ComputerCraft program to auto-stock craftable items in an AppliedEnergistics network

## Setup

#### Connect an ME Interface to the back of a computer

* Make sure it's facing **the back of the computer**!  It can't be placed on any other side.
* Make sure it's a cubic interface (don't use the panel version)
* Wrench it until the arrow points at the computer
* Obviously the interface should be connected to your network :)

Example:

#### Install the program

This installer should download everything you need:

```
pastebin run KghxhDha
```

When it's running, it should look something like this:
